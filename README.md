## Setup

Install the package (you can use a virtual environment you created, or create a new one). The package was developed with Python 3.8, but should work with Python >= 3.6

To install with pip, simply run this from the project root:

```bash
pip install ./
```

If you intend to do changes in the package, you can install in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e ./
```
